# Enrichment Materials - G. Burgess / AppAcademy / May 2020

This is a collection of materials related to the AppAcademy JS/Py curriculum
and to developing your own software engineering skills.

NOTE ON STYLE: I like to read and write conversational English, so I talk about my experience and habits, and may occasionally refer to the reader as 'you', as well.  Other instructors will have their own thoughts on these things, which will generally be different from mine, and they would likely present this material somewhat differently.

The product of sorting out these kinds of meta-considerations is usually an institutional *style guide* - when you join a software development team this is one of the first things you should ask about, because if they have one you will look smart (and be able to write compliant code!), and if they don't your team lead will at least know that you ask good questions!
